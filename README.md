# Mathematical Model of Histone Acetylation

This repository contains Python scripts and data used to develop an ODE-based (Ordinary Differential Equation) mathematical model of histone acetylation.

## Folder Structure

- **pycodes**: This folder contains scripts used for developing the ODE model and routines to plot the results.
  - **Modelling analyses**: `pycodes/modelling_analyses.ipynb`
- **data**: This folder contains the measured histone acetylation data used for modelling.

## Usage

To run the model and plot the results, navigate to the `pycodes` directory and execute the scripts. The Jupyter notebook `modelling_analyses.ipynb` provides an interactive way to analyze the model and visualize the results.
